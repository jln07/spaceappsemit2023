<p>For interacting with the data we can use Google Colab and Jupyter Notebooks; these are user-friendly tools that allow you to create and run code without needing expert programming skills.</p>

<p>Google Colab is free and open source; you can use it without any charges on your google cloud account.</p>

<p>Jupyter notebook is a web application that is free, open-source, and was developed as a spinoff of IPython. It enables users to create and share computation documents.</p>

<p>Follow the following steps:</p>

<ol>  
<li>Navigate to the <a href= "https://github.com/nasa/EMIT-Data-Resources">EMIT-Data-Resources</a> a github</li>
<li>Fork the repository.</li>
<li>From the repository contents pick a jupyter notebook. For example:  <a href="https://github.com/nasa/EMIT-Data-Resources/blob/main/python/tutorials/Exploring_EMIT_L2A_Reflectance.ipynb"> Exploring EMIT L2A Reflectance</a>a</li>
<li>Once you’re looking at the preview of the document download the raw file (This file will have an .ipynb extension)</li>
<li>Go to <a href="https://colab.research.google.com"></a> and login with your google account</li>
<li>Upload your . ipynb file</li>
<li>Once it’s uploaded, double click on it and you will see the jupyter notebook running in google colab.</li>
<li>You’re all set, now follow the instructions in the notebook and explore!</li>
</ol>
