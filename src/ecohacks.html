<p>What can I do to fight climate change?</p>
<ul>
<li>Convert old energy appliances to new energy efficient ones</li>
<li>Drive less, bike, walk, take public transport</li>
<li>Reduce overall water usage</li>
<li>Advocate for renewable energy</li>
<li>Educate yourself & others about climate change and what they can do about it</li>
<li>Invest in <a href="https://greenly.earth/en-us">carbon offsetting programs</a> for unavoidable carbon emissions. </li>
<li>Inspire others to take action against climate change</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few examples of ways you can fight climate change and make a difference in your community. The average U.S. citizen emits 15 metric tons in just one year, by taking steps against climate change you can emit as little as 5. If just 100 people in the U.S. went out of their way to emit less CO<sub>2</sub> then 500 metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> would be prevented from escaping into our atmosphere. And it would only keep going up from there. If 100,000 people took steps against climate change you could prevent half a million metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> from escaping into the atmosphere. That's as much as keeping 49.5 Eiffel towers worth of CO<sub>2</sub> from making it into our atmosphere. Although it seems like a losing battle against climate change, with enough people, you can make an impact on the entire world around you. 49.5 Eiffel towers worth of an impact.</p>
