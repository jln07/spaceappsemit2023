<h1>How the environment IMPACTS YOU and your COMMUNITY, and your FAMILY.</h1>

<p>
<h3>According to the Environnmental Protection Agency, Enviromental justice is the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people, regardless of race, color, national origin or income.</h3>
As the years progress. Climates, temperatures, and weather rapidly change and as access to clean resources become scarce. Trends always point to lack of resources and inhumane living conditions for those living in less wealthy areas.
To prevent this we need to have enforced reporting and protection from environmental and health hazards, examples include high levels of air pollution, and contanminated water sources or poor soil quality. 
All should have access to the information and have an educated idea of their local to even global environment. We aim to make access to that very information, easy to digest and easy to report. We aimed to enhance the experience by adding bilingual support as well!
